## Version 0.2.5 — March 1, 2012

  - Added support for HTTP Basic Auth by working around the fact that Neo4j
    doesn't maintain the username and password in the URLs it returns (#7).
    Many thanks to @anatoliychakkaev for finding this and suggesting the fix.

## Version 0.2.4 — January 29, 2012

  - Updated library to support Neo4j 1.6. Still supports 1.5 and 1.4. No
    changes were actually needed, but uses the new official Cypher endpoint
    now instead of the deprecated plugin endpoint, if it's available.

## Version 0.2.3 — January 25, 2012

  - Updated library to support Neo4j 1.5. Still supports 1.4.
  - Added a GraphDatabase::getVersion(_) method. Neo4j 1.5 onwards returns the
    version number, so this method returns 1.4 for older versions of Neo4j.
